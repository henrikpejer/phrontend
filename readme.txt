I believe it would be nice to have a better controll of the frontend: adding js/css. Updating parts of a page etc.

I think that it is a good idea to extract this into it's own little system.

I guess one could really say that in MVC we could have a good ORM as M, some-other nice concept as C and this as the V, sortof.

Bah, we'll see where we will end up. Maybe I've taken the wrong turn already and don't know jack about this web-dev-thing, right?
